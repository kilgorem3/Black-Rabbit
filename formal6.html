			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>The article on sportsnetworker was titled Top 10 Resources for Sports Management Students. This article seems like it is very useful and helpful because its written by someone who has majored in the field and decided to share what someone can do to further their knowledge in sports management. In this article he lists ten resources someone can use and then along with each resource he explained why. I think this is helpful and would definitely make use of some of the resources he has given because he has been through this all. He has enough knowledge and experience in the educational part to tell you some of the exact things you should do to get ahead. Underneath the first resource he posted (Sports Business Journal) he said, 
“Largely considered “the Bible of sports business,” Sports Business Journal is a must read for anyone in the sports industry, and anyone looking to break into the sports industry.  The Sports Business Journal covers all areas of sports, from Marketing and Sponsorship to Media, from Labor and Agents to Facilities.  Regardless of your area of interest, you’ll have all the latest industry information at your fingertips.  While this is not a free resource, Sports Business Journal does offer generous student discounts.”(Thompson)
Just from this first resource, how can a student not get this journal and make use of it? When someone uses a term as strong as “The Bible” (Atkins) to stress importance, it’s obviously something that’s very useful. This article not only provides readings a student can do, but things someone can get involved in as well. For example one of his resources was “Work in Sports”. Here he says, 
“Workinsports.com is “The #1 job board in the sports industry.”  With over 5800 employers, 2600 sports jobs, and 550 internships currently listed, Workinsports.com can help you find the perfect internship to gain experience and build your resume.  It should also be your number one resource for finding your dream job after graduation.”(Thompson)
This is something students in all majors wish they had. He just gave a resource that one can get connected with to get a start in the field.
