		<p>The Television has always been my friend. Ever since I was little I have always loved watching cartoons, especially the ones I wasn’t allowed watching that came on during the adult hours. I loved watching shows such as “The Simpsons”, “Family Guy” and shows of that nature. As I started to grow older, the jokes and the references that were made on the shows started making more and more sense. These shows are probably some of the reasons why I’m so goofy and act the way I do today. </p>
<p>In high school, to make the story short, I found a group of friends with the same personality as me and a lot of the same interests. In this group we have artists, intellects, comedians, and writers. Great thing about it is, we all love cartoons, especially Cartoon Network (CN). As the years went on and our relationships with each other grew stronger and stronger we came to the conclusion that we didn’t want to break this clique of friends we had built over the years. I remember we had a table in the lunchroom we would all sit at and eat. We had so many crazy times there. There would be days we would get the whole lunchroom rowdy and laughing. Or times when we would crack jokes on each other for a good hour to the point where we were all crying. I don’t remember a single day I had lunch without laughing hysterically, it just didn’t seem normal if we weren’t.</p> 
<p>As we started realizing this, we also realized that we all had a sense of youth in us that we never wanted to leave. It’s because of this we eventually began designing a show, in high school! We realized that, the shows that came on the T.V. had a certain impact on all of us. With Cartoon Network, it gives all of us a chance to get away from whatever was bothering us and make us laugh. That’s why we want to make a show that will do the same for others. Just think about it, you could be having a terrible day and turn on a show like Family Guy and laugh to the point where it takes your mind off of what was even irritating you for that certain time period. I’ve always been the kid who wanted to make a difference in the world but was never sure how I was going to be able to do that. Now, I’m slowly realizing that this show can help me do exactly that. If I can get this show on television and make people laugh and be entertained then I think I would have not only accomplished my goals as a creator of a television show but to be able to make a difference in people’s lives as well. And until I will not stop until I achieve this goal and dream.</P>
<p>The thing that really got to me was one day when all of the seniors were called down to the theater to have an assembly. Now understand that this show means a huge deal for me, so I prayed a lot over it. The man who came in to talk to us was a graduate from St. Xavier a while ago. He was here to share his success in his new movie (a documentary) about the ocean. I was fascinated. All I could think about was how this must be a message or sign from God. Now, I’m a person who will get distracted from anything pretty easily because I have A.D.D (attention deficit disorder), but during this time there was nothing that could disengage me from everything he was sharing with us. I just couldn’t wait until he was finished so I could go and speak with him. I had to find out if he was capable of helping my friends and I start this show. So as he was wrapping up at the end and everyone was leaving, I went up to him to introduce myself and tell him how interested and inspired I was. He was very happy to hear how excited I was about something we both shared in common which was the show industry. After talking to him for a while he eventually told me that he was a producer! My heart almost exploded out of my chest. At the end of the conversation he gave me his card and told me that if I really wanted to do this he would help all of us out. There was no way I could let this opportunity slip away. That person there is the man who will be helping me and my friends’ dream come true.</P>
<p>With this show everyone has a responsibility. Mine so happens to be that they want me to get my business degree so that when I get out of college, I will be able to manage the show. This is why I am going into Business here at Michigan State. I will also be a part of the show directly as well. I will be one of the characters and have the opportunity to have my voice as one of the characters. Even though I’m slightly far away in Michigan away from all of my friends making the show, every chance I get to go back I do. During some of those times we all will get together and go over anything that’s new to get everyone (mainly me) up to date with everything that’s going on. We also take care of voiceovers during those times and things of that sort.  It’s kind of crazy how a dream like this is slowly coming into the making.</P>  
<p>Michigan State has given me an opportunity to accomplish dreams I’ve had ever since I was a little kid. I was given a scholarship to come here to play football, but obviously along with sports comes academics. Although this is a Big10 school for sports that will allow me to showcase my talents on the field, I’m also not naive enough to know that this school has also given me an opportunity to get a  free education, something my family values most. Now that I’m here at Michigan State I plan on majoring in Business as of now to help me in one of my other goals off the field. My T.V show aspirations will be the thing that keeps my head on straight and working as hard as I can to keep my grades high so that I can get into the Business College.
