			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Just how GTA has had a negative impact on society, this game The Detective will have more of a positive feed for people’s minds as they play it. Hopefully the game will help people realize the good from the bad and how when you’re doing things that are wrong and bad, you’ll eventually get caught. So now instead of weak minded people being tempted in the wrong way, why not help them out? Someone can put out a game that is for the good but also fun and intense as well. Maybe that’s all people are looking for anyway, something that is intense and has a lot of action. People think that you have to be a criminal or be playing something that goes against the law to be intense and fun. This game is a game that can finally show people that there actually are games for the good that can give you that same feeling. There is always a start to something new that can change the world and thoughts of people, somewhere, someone just as to make that initial step to do so. With an idea like this, who’s to say that The Detective can’t be that change. </p>
