		<p>In today’s society, one of the biggest problems is the social violence. There is not a day that goes by where you don’t hear about a killing or some violent act that has happened that day. I think there are a lot of factors that play into peoples’ motives for doing these things as well. A lot of the movies, songs, books, and games of today do nothing but put ideas of violence into people’s minds. As a result more people are acting out and being sent to jail. It has gotten so bad that a couple of years ago they had to release a good number of inmates because the jails were getting too full and they had nowhere else to put incoming inmates. All of the violence makes me think about a video game called Grand Theft Auto. This is a prime example of something that many can say has had an influence on today’s violence in the society. </p>
