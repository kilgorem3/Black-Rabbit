Writing connects both the reading and the research. Writing plays an important factor when it comes to statistics and research. Without writing no one would be able to recollect what people have previously said about a something like machinery or medicine. Writing is the way we get the statistic part of our research today, without it, nobody would have factual evidence to support conclusions that they have come to. Without statistical support, you can’t prove that something is better or worse than another. Just like any other major, writing shows ones knowledge of what they have learned and if they really have a grasp on what goes on in that particular discipline. With the medical part of sports management, think about all the time you go into a doctor’s office for an appointment. They always have documentation of all of your visits to help with their knowledge of progress you’ve made. As soon as you go in they have you sit down and ask you a series of questions to see where you are and they record it on the computer. As for the business part of it, writing and records help people make decisions on things like players they want and money records to see their budget to find out the amount of money they can spend. Writing is the essential part of the many things that go into sports management. Here is a small diagram that shows an example of the order of part of the writing process one would see in the medical field of sports.

According to my Trainer Dave, communication between not only each other as employees in the business, but more importantly between the athlete and the trainer is crucial. Without effective communication, a reason for an athlete’s visit could be pointless. It’s very important in this certain field of study because for example if someone gets hurt, and they are receiving treatment. If something is very painful to the player but nothings said to the trainer, it could actually be hurting the athlete because whatever medical attention they are receiving could actually be worsening their injury.

These three skills are crucial in ones journey to major in sports management. They are not only useful in college but will continue to be used in the everyday life of a sports manager. Getting a good grasp on the skills now will be very essential in your journey to a successful  career academically and furthermore, career wise.
