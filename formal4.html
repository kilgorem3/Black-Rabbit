			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Those are a few topics to let you get an idea on what types of research one could possibly do. Along with topics as those, one of the huge topics for sports management on the medical part is health. Research plays a big part in this because we need to know what medicines and machines that are being used on athletes are beneficial and what are not helping. If certain research on a machine or medicine shows that it has not helped a player to what it was assumed, they would make an investment on something newer and better. But see, how would they do that? They would also have to do research on a newer machine to see what separates that from the old machine and statistically what it’s done for other athletes who have used it. Recovery is a big part of helping athletes physically/medically. You need to know what someone can and can’t do under certain circumstances. Say an athlete gets injured, breaks a bone, and needs surgery. As a medical trainer you need to be able to tell them things like why it’s important that they don’t use tobacco products because it slows down the healing process. Research in this field is inevitable, and without it you won’t last long.
