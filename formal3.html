			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>When it comes to sports management, research plays a very important part. In this discipline you’re not only dealing with possibly money, but things that are constantly changing whether you’re seeing a rise or fall in your profit. Sports management deals a lot with statistics. Statistics is one of the main things that keeps sports managers active and quite honestly, with jobs for the most part. For example if you’re an agent you would want something that shows evidence that if your making changes with putting new players on a team, that it would be beneficial. As a manager of a team you need to do research on the players you are looking to sign to see about thing like: Is their health good? Are they a consistent player? How is their attitude and chemistry towards other players on the team? What type of person are they on and off the field/court? The list could go on and on. You need statistics like so to be able to present to the owner of the team that your choices are good enough to show his/her team will have a chance to be a championship team. Research gives you the opportunity to take calculated risks and back-up the decisions you make. Without research, how would things ever improve? Research gives disciplines like sports management a chance to make additions to things like teams or pieces of equipment to better that particular area. When you do research in sports management, you can literally research anything that has to do with sports, or medicine that affect the players. To show some of the topics of research that one may do, here is the Table of Contents from Journal of Applied Sports Management to get an idea.
