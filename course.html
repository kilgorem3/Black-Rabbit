Before entering into college level writing classes (WRA110), some would say I was a very good writer. I have always liked writing, which ties into my future career goals of writing scripts for television shows. I have what is called A.D.D (attention deficit disorder), meaning my mind wonders and scatters all over the place (I have a hard time staying focused).  This is one of the reasons writing comes so easy to me. I have never been that person to sit there when I am writing a paper and just stare at the computer screen drawing blanks because I don’t know what to type. In fact, it’s just the opposite for me. If I’m caught staring at the computer it’s usually because I have so many ideas in my mind that I want to say but just don’t know where to start. That’s why script writing is a definite consideration for someone like me because people’s minds’ like to wander are often very creative, and although it may be tough for other to sit and write papers with their A.D.D, for me, I find it very easy.
 Coming into Wra110, I was expected a boring rigorous course that would be a struggle to keep up with. Now I’m not going to say it wasn’t tedious at some points along the way but we did different things to keep it interesting. The way the class is set up is to gradually ease you into the college level and amount of writing. This process may seem a little fast, but that’s only because it is. As you get further into the course though, the writing becomes easier and you get used to the lengths and pace of the work being done in the class. For example, we had about five major papers we needed to do this semester. Each paper got progressively harder and harder. With each assignment it was something new and something to be learned whether it was something about ourselves, society, our major, etc. 
For the first essay we had to write on the topic “Lived Experiences”. In this essay we had to write about a piece technology and our chosen major. We were instructed to pick a piece of technology and relate it to how that helped us come to a conclusion on what we wanted to study. This by far was the easiest to me personally because we got to tell our story a little and what interested us. Who wouldn’t like to do that? The great thing about this essay was that it was a 1,200 word limit with a very open ended topic. There were barely any requirements, we were just given a topic to write about and then to go and do it, pretty nice assignment. 
In the second assignment we had a writing topic on “cultural analysis”. In this paper we had to pick an artifact and relate it to a social issue and tell how that has an effect on it. At the end we were to come up with an artifact on our on that we could replace this artifact with or just something outright better to have a more positive impact on society. This project was a little more structured and a little longer in length. It was still a pretty cool paper to write on because you got to pick a social issue you felt strong about and talk about it. On top of that you got to use an artifact that went along with it and use that as an additional source of reasoning of why it is such a problem. With the artifact you were to explain its relevance to the issue and what it was and then what I did for the end was created something to counter that bad artifact. This paper was very interesting and showed your awareness and creativity. 
	Lastly, we had a paper with the topic of “Formal Research”. This by far was the most challenging. Not only was the word count long but we had very specific goals to achieve within the paper. We were to write about our major as if we were talking to someone who had no clue on what to expect in that discipline. We were to specifically focus on the writing, reading, and researching aspects of this informative essay. With this, you would really have to be on top of things every step throughout the way. This is not a paper you can procrastinate with. With the research, interviewing, and specific requirement within your research (scholarly article), the paper was tough. 
	This course was definitely an interesting one. As you go along in the class you can really see the smooth, yet firm transition into getting progressively harder and harder. 
	The WRA course was very interesting to me. Coming into the course the professors may have a certain expectation on what they want the outcome with knowledge gained during this class. For me personally since I liked writing so much, gaining a lot of new experience with writing wasn’t the case for me. But, I did learn some new things during the course though. What I’m getting at is that you may not get exactly what the course expects you to get out of it, but as long as you’re getting something out of it then that’s what most importantly matters. As long as you apply yourself, you’re guaranteed to gain new knowledge from WRA110.
