			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>A solution to this game that would be effect is to make a top notch high selling game that contradicts everything that Grand Theft Auto stands for. The game will be called The Detective. In this game you’re an undercover cop. And just like GTA you’re put in a storyline missions to go out on these dangerous and deadly challenges to try and catch these big time mob bosses and dangerous men around the world. In this game, you’re the head of the force. You determine the next move your squad is going to take based on the information it tells you’re in the game. So not only do you play the game to just go out and catch these big time criminals, but you have to be able to think a little in a way that’s best for your force. If not, you’ll more than likely lead them to death. Your job as a player will be to crack down on all of the major illegal activity happening around the world and restoring the law and order where it needs to be. In the game you’ll be able to drive any car you want and while driving change the music to the genre that suits you best. Everything else such as guns and clothes will have to be earned by going on to the next mission. Considering how this game is based off of GTA, but just in a contradicting way, the success of the game should be very high. There will also be cheat codes provided on the internet for those who are really into the game to get certain things such as weapons and cars that either is not on the game or that will take a long time to unlock. </p>
