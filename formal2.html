		<p>Before discussing what one will have to be able to do in order to survive in the physical and medical technological aspect of sports management, it would be necessary to explain what sports management is in the first place. According to Communication Computer and Information Science, “Sports management is a field of education and vocation concerning the business aspect of sport. Sport management involves many aspects, such as the important data of athletes, sports equipment, and the records of games, etc.” There are many different areas in the field one can specialize in when it comes to sports management. Usually when people think of sports management they automatically think of managing people. People seem to think managing professional or collegiate athletes is what sports management is. Little do a lot know, there is much more than just that part to the discipline of sports management. Other areas that go into sports management are areas such as marketing, setting up sports events, finance, economics, and information.  The main parts in sports management are the areas of business and medicine. With a medicine degree you can go from anywhere along the lines as being a dietitian to helping players with their problems mentally and physically. </p>
