		<p>Before discussing what one will have to be able to do in order to survive in the physical and medical technological aspect of sports management, it would be necessary to explain what sports management is in the first place. According to Communication Computer and Information Science, “Sports management is a field of education and vocation concerning the business aspect of sport. Sport management involves many aspects, such as the important data of athletes, sports equipment, and the records of games, etc.” There are many different areas in the field one can specialize in when it comes to sports management. Usually when people think of sports management they automatically think of managing people. People seem to think managing professional or collegiate athletes is what sports management is. Little do a lot know, there is much more than just that part to the discipline of sports management. Other areas that go into sports management are areas such as marketing, setting up sports events, finance, economics, and information.  The main parts in sports management are the areas of business and medicine. With a medicine degree you can go from anywhere along the lines as being a dietitian to helping players with their problems mentally and physically. 
According to Sportsmanagementdegreehub,
 “Sports management degrees provide students with fundamental knowledge and skills centered on finance, management, marketing and law pertaining to the organizations in the sports industry. The coursework in sports management degree programs typically prepare students for careers with amateur, collegiate and professional sports organizations. These students are able to capitalize on several different types of sport related opportunities after graduating from a sports management program. Many established business professionals decide to go back to school in order to make a successful career transition into the sports industry. Both undergraduate and graduate students can benefit from considering a degree in sports management. The sports industry in America currently generates over $200 billion annually.”(Atkins)
