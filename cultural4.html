			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The issue in this game is that the whole game is based on violence and criminal act, criminal act against not only people but the government and law as well. It’s all about doing whatever you can to build yourself up the ladder of being one of the best criminals in the world. All throughout the game you’re going around committing all of these crimes without worrying about any consequence (literally and figuratively). In the real world you don’t have to worry about getting in any type of trouble for the crimes and harsh acts your committing in the game. As well as in the game the chances of you escaping and being free to go on to the next mission is very high and possible. That in itself is bad because it gives people a false impression of what it’s really like in the real world. Just think about all of the weak minded people there are in the world today. This game does nothing but pollutes their minds and makes them think that these cruel acts are acceptable. Not only the weak minded people that could possibly have the knowledge to overcome these falsified and unrealistic motives in life, but what about the young children in the world who play this game. Kids who are barely know right from wrong and still are forming a conscience and discovering what’s good and bad in this world. Here the world is complaining about how cruel and violent the place has become but look at some of the things that are leading to it. So as these young kids continue to grow and get older some of these false ideas of what reality is like are instilled into their heads and now plays a part on their everyday life. Now, those violent and illegal acts that they did in the game, takes a toll on how they choose to live in the real world. The acts in the game allow you to be reckless without consequence and for a lot of people it’s hard to separate the fantasy from actuality. Theres also a lot of sexual things in the game as well like prostitution and strip clubs and society want to know why there are so many rapes and things of that nature. Grand Theft Auto could have a huge play in that as well. Putting in minds of people that it’s okay to walk around and just beat up a girl and take her money without any type of consequence and think that somebody will just sit there and watch you do that. All this game does essentially is give people these dark nasty thoughts about what they wish they could do so in order to act those out they get on the game and do it. A place where they can feel safe in this virtual world of theirs and not have to worry about getting in trouble for the way the feel and doing what they want to do. Well have people realized some people tend to get reality and virtuality mixed? There are a lot of people like that in today’s society. Even the normal everyday business workers tend to have small glimpses of things of that nature. </p>
