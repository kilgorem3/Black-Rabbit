		<p>Sports management covers many different areas, from a financial aspect all the way to working medically with players in that particular sport. To accomplish all of these different tasks in sports management, one needs to know what goes in to the academic part of sports management. Many get into the discipline and are either lost or find it difficult because they came in with barely any knowledge as to how and what you need to know to succeed. In a field like this, things change and new information is presented all the time. In order to do so they will need to know what goes in to the research, reading and writing in the field.  For example there is a great deal of technology that plays a part in doing so. In many cases there have been different levels of controversy with using certain tools, upgrading, or outright getting rid of certain pieces of equipment in the medical field of sports management. With the amount of technology that is available it is beneficial to know the research, writing, and reading necessary to be able to succeed and move forward. </p>
